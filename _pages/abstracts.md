The deadlines for special session proposals and contributed talks have passed.

* Late submissions of contributed talk abstracts may be considered. They should be submitted through the [contributed talk submission portal](https://forms.gle/WASX4wZxVRj9ZdaA8). 

* Speakers at accepted special sessions that have not yet submitted their abstracts should do so **immediately** through the [special session abstract submission portal](https://forms.gle/fg9Mv41qXBGjYZia6) 

Abstracts should use use [Template_Abstract_Talk.tex](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ItnMS3HjzMoqc7zmBHZwfZQ5hlfdt05Q/view?usp=sharing) to submit an abstract and rename the file LaTeX and pdf files to FirstNameLastName.tex and FirstNameLastName.pdf, based on the name of the speaker, before submitting these files to the webform.

The LaTex templates are also provided on the submission portal, and on Overleaf ([template for talk abstracts](https://www.overleaf.com/read/tmfvtzwjwrnv#e182d2)).  Please follow the instructions given in the templates. This is to avoid problems when compiling the program book of the conference. Please refrain from changing the preamble of the .tex file, and from adding your own commands and macros. Please do not use the \bibliography environment or .bibtex files.

Should you have any questions, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact the organizers at <info@mcm2025chicago.org>.
