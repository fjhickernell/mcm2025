The portal for special sessions and contributed talk submissions is open! 
* A special session can be organized by 1-3 organizers and should focus on a well-defined topic related to the scope of the conference. Each special session should consist of 3-4 talks by experts on the topic of the session.  Proposals for special sessions should be submitted to the special [session submission portal](https://forms.gle/nnkTjCKw6Bgo7wGZA) by **January 31, 2025**. The submission webform will require the details of the organizer/s, a description of the special session, and the names and affiliations of the proposed speakers. Please use [Template_Special_Session.tex](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xdGM0e-qapDrQied-0D_-_yRiYWncEfQ/view?usp=sharing) to submit special session proposals and rename the file to FirstNameLastName.tex and FirstNameLastName.pdf, based on the name of one organizer, before submitting these files to the webform.  Abstracts for talks in a special session are required only after the session is accepted.
* A contributed talk pertaining to the scope of the MCQMC conference can be given by any participant who is not already giving a talk in a special session. Abstracts for contributed talks should be submitted to the [contributed talk submission portal](https://forms.gle/WASX4wZxVRj9ZdaA8) by **February 28, 2025**. Please use [Template_Abstract_Talk.tex](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ItnMS3HjzMoqc7zmBHZwfZQ5hlfdt05Q/view?usp=sharing) to submit an abstract and rename the file to FirstNameLastName.tex and FirstNameLastName.pdf, based on the name of the speaker, before submitting these files to the webform.

Special sessions and contributed talks will be accepted on a rolling basis as received, and at the latest by mid-March.  These talks will be 25 minutes each in length, leaving 5 minutes for questions and transition to the next talk.

The LaTex templates are also provided on the submission portal, and on Overleaf ([template for special session proposals](https://www.overleaf.com/read/yhqqvsgngtyt#de08ce) and [template for talk abstracts](https://www.overleaf.com/read/tmfvtzwjwrnv#e182d2)).  Please follow the instructions given in the templates. This is to avoid problems when compiling the program book of the conference. Please refrain from changing the preamble of the .tex file, and from adding your own commands and macros. Please do not use the \bibliography environment or .bibtex files.
