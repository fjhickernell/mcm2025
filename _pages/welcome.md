The biennial International Conference on Monte Carlo Methods and Applications (MCM) (formerly IMACS Seminar on Monte Carlo Methods) is one of the most prominent conference series devoted to research on stochastic simulation and Monte Carlo methods. The 15th edition, MCM 2025, will take place from July 28 to August 1, 2025, at the Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, US. MCM 2025 brings together a multidisciplinary community of Monte Carlo researchers and practitioners to share their latest discoveries.

<!--This 15th edition aims to cover traditional topics of MCM conferences (Computational statistical physics, Quasi Monte Carlo methods, Markov Chain Monte Carlo in high dimension, Multilevel methods, Rare events simulation, Stochastic gradient and other stochastic optimization methods…) as well as emerging topics coming from applications and from artificial intelligence as: Generative models, Experimental design in Uncertainty Quantification, Monte Carlo simulations and High Performance computing, Reinforcement learning and control, Statistical learning and Monte Carlo sampling, Economic and industrial applications (Deeptech, finance, medicine, climate risks for instance).
